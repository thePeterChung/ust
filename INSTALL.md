# Universal Structure Toolkit – Beginner’s Guide (Obsidian Version)

Welcome to the **Universal Structure Toolkit (UST)**! This toolkit is designed to help you **analyze, reason and think critically** before writing.  
Writing is a reflection of thought, not the starting point. UST provides **structured prompts and concept scaffolds** so that learners can **develop adaptive thinking skills** across any domain.  

This guide will show you how to open and navigate the toolkit in **Obsidian**, including how to use questions as **critical thinking scaffolds** and explore links visually.  


## 1. Install Obsidian

1. Go to [https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)  
2. Download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).  
3. Install and open Obsidian.


## 2. Add the [UST Files](/build/zip) to Your Vault

**Option A – New Vault (Recommended for Beginners)**  
1. In Obsidian, click **“Create new vault”**.  
2. Name it something like `UST`.  
3. Choose a folder location on your computer.  

**Option B – Existing Vault**  
1. Locate your Obsidian vault folder.  
2. Copy the UST folder (`UST-Obsidian-["Raw","Clean"]-["Unix","Win"]/`) into it.  


## 3. Explore the Graph View  

1. Open Obsidian.  
2. Press `Ctrl+G` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+G` (Mac) to open **Graph View**.  
3. Zoom and pan to see all questions as **connected thinking nodes**.  
4. Click a node to open its question note.


## 4. Navigating the Toolkit  

**A – Using the Index Pages**  
- Each structure folder has a Index Page inside. Open `_Heros-Journey.md` in the vault folder `/Film/Heros-Journey`.  
- Click on any question link to open its note.  

**B – Browsing the Folder Structure**  
- Open the **File Explorer** in Obsidian (left toolbar).  
- Navigate to a level folder: `Beginner/`, `Intermediate/`, `Advanced/`, `Meta_Expert/`.  
- Inside each folder, open a structure-part folder like `Heros-Journey/Beginner/[1-12]_Ordinary_World`.  


## 5. Inside a Question Note  

Each question file looks like this:  

```
Who is the hero before the journey begins?
**Question ID:** Heros-Journey.B.1.2

**Concept:** [[Framing]]

**Structure Part:** [[Heros-Journey-B-[1-12]_Ordinary_World.md]]

**Level:** Beginner

**Structure:** [[Heros-Journey]]

**Discipline:** Film

(Write your answer here…)
```

- The filename is the essay question.  
- The Structure Part link lets you see **related thinking pathways**.  
- You can write notes directly under the question or use it as a **critical thinking scaffold** before writing. 


## 6. Reframing Questions as Flexible Stems

Each UST question can act as a **flexible stem**, enabling learners to apply it to **any context or material**, not just essays.  

- Replace key nouns or actions with blanks to generalize the question.  
- Apply the stem to academic, professional, creative or personal scenarios.  
- Use this process as a **critical thinking scaffold** to analyze, compare and reason.  

**Example:**

Original Question: Who is the hero before the journey begins?

Generalized Stem: Who is ___ before ___ begins?

Applied to different contexts:  
- Academic Essay: Who is the hero before the climate action begins?  
- Policy Analysis: Who are the key stakeholders before implementing a new law?  
- Personal Reflection: Who am I before starting this new phase of life?  
- Creative Writing: Who is the protagonist before the story’s conflict emerges?

This demonstrates that UST questions are not just prompts but **critical thinking tools** that can be adapted for **any material or scenario**. 


## 7. Tips for Students

- Use Graph View to explore **conceptual and reasoning connections**.  
- Follow Structure Part links to see how questions guide reasoning across levels.  
- Take your own notes Obsidian is non destructive so you can freely add, edit or link your content as part of your thinking process.  


## 8. Recommended Obsidian Settings

- Graph View → Show Tags (visualize concepts for reasoning)
- Core Plugins → Backlinks (to see where questions connect)
- Core Plugins → Outline (to quickly jump in long notes)


## 9. Summary

- Install Obsidian.
- Copy UST folders into a vault.
- Use Index pages, folder navigation or Graph View to browse.
- Click questions to open and **explore ideas before writing**.
- Reframe questions to apply **critical thinking to any material**.  
- Use links to explore **related reasoning pathways**.

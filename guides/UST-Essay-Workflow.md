## Essay Prompt Workflow  

*How to use UST when starting from an essay prompt*

This workflow helps you **think first**, **develop a thesis** and **plan arguments** before writing.


---

### **Step 1 – Read and Understand the Essay Prompt**

- Identify **keywords**, **scope**, **criteria** and **implicit assumptions**.  

*Example Prompt:* “Evaluate the effectiveness of climate change mitigation policies before implementation.”

### **Step 2 – Select a UST Structure That Offers a Useful Perspective**

- Browse UST structures (e.g., **Hero’s Journey**, **Toulmin**, **Systems Thinking**, **Design Thinking**).  
- Choose a structure for its **thinking lens**, not for topical match.  

*Chosen Structure:* **Hero’s Journey**  
*Seed Question:* “Who is the hero before the journey begins?”

### **Step 3 – Adapt the UST Question to Fit the Prompt**

- Generalize the question into a flexible stem, then map it to your domain.  

- **Stem:** “Who is ___ before ___ begins?”  
- **Mapped to prompt:** “Who are the key actors before climate change mitigation begins?”

### **Step 4 – Answer the Question Critically**

- Use **research** and **reasoning** (interpret, compare, synthesize, logic, analyze & evaluate).  

*Example Answer:* “Before mitigation policies are enacted, government agencies, NGOs and community leaders often hold fragmented perspectives, limited coordination and uneven influence.”

### **Step 5 – Reframe Answer into a Thesis Statement**

- Convert your descriptive answer into a **clear, evaluative thesis** that addresses the prompt.  

*Reframed Thesis:* “Early stage climate mitigation underperforms because fragmented perspectives and weak coordination among key actors delay unified action.”

### **Step 6 – Build Arguments to Support the Thesis (Planning Only)**

- Apply a reasoning framework (e.g., **Toulmin**) to outline claims, evidence and warrants.  
- Later convert to **PEEL** paragraphs during writing.  

*Sketch:*  
  - **Claim:** Fragmentation delays implementation.  
  - **Evidence:** Case studies of policy rollout lags.  
  - **Warrant:** Cross-actor coordination is necessary for timely action.

### **Step 7 – Move to Writing (Outside UST)**

- Draft the essay using your thesis and planned arguments.  
- Use PEEL (Point–Evidence–Explanation–Link) or your preferred paragraph model.

### **Step 8 – Review and Iterate**

- **Check alignment:** Does the thesis fully answer the prompt?  
- **Stress test:** Consider counterarguments and alternative structures (e.g., Systems Thinking) to probe weaknesses.  
- **Evidence audit:** Are claims supported by credible sources?  
- **Concept pass:** Use UST concept tags (e.g., **Conflict**, **Scale** and **Focus**) to spot gaps.  
- **Revise:** Update thesis/arguments based on findings.

## Optional Use Cases

- **Diagnose an existing draft:** Map paragraphs to a UST structure to reveal gaps, tangents, or missing warrants.  
- **Interdisciplinary reframing:** Run the same prompt through a second structure (e.g. **Design Thinking**) to uncover new angles.  
- **Non-essay outputs:** Use the plan to create policy memos, briefs, talks or research posters.  
- **Group work:** Assign roles by structure parts (e.g., problem framing, counterarguments and synthesis).  
- **AI collab mode:** Use UST questions as **structured prompts** for an LLM; keep human control over **Reframe → Thesis** and argument planning.

## Summary of Workflow

**Prompt → Choose Structure → Adapt UST Question (Stem) → Answer Critically → Reframe into Thesis → Plan Arguments (Toulmin) → Write (PEEL) → Review & Iterate**

- **Thinking first, writing second.**  
- **Reframing** is the bridge from structured Q&A to an argument ready thesis.  
- **Iteration** improves accuracy, depth and transfer across disciplines.

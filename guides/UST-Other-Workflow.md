## Other Workflows  

*Alternative ways to use UST beyond starting from a prompt*

These workflows show how UST supports **reviewing**, **brainstorming** and **cross-disciplinary thinking**.

### **Workflow 1 – Review an Existing Essay (Using the Toulmin Model)**

Use this workflow when you have a draft and want to improve **clarity, depth and logical structure**.

We apply the **Toulmin Model** because it breaks arguments into clear parts: **Claim, Evidence, Warrant, Backing, Qualifier and Rebuttal** helping you see where reasoning is strong or weak.


**Step 1 – Map Each Paragraph to UST Questions**  

- Identify which **Toulmin element** (e.g., Claim, Warrant, Rebuttal) or **UST concept** each paragraph addresses.  
- Spot **orphan ideas** content that doesn’t serve any structural or argumentative purpose.

**Step 2 – Diagnose Gaps**  

- Missing **why/how reasoning**? That’s a warrant gap.  
- No counterarguments? Add Toulmin’s **rebuttal** or **qualifier** using UST’s opposition questions.

**Step 3 – Reframe Weak Sections**  

- Revisit UST questions for each element.  
- Ask: *Does this paragraph fully support the claim or explain the reasoning?*  
- Rewrite vague content as **focused mini-theses** with evidence and logical connectors.

**Step 4 – Iterate**  

- Add backing where needed.  
- Test assumptions, refine qualifiers and adjust the thesis if your strongest evidence shifts the main focus of the argument.

### **Workflow 2 – Brainstorm for Ideas**

Use this when you don’t yet know your angle or need diverse perspectives.

**Step 1 – Choose Multiple Structures**

- Select 2–3 UST structures from different domains (e.g. **Hero’s Journey**, **Systems Thinking** and **Dialectical Reasoning**).

**Step 2 – Run Seed Questions Rapid-Fire**

- For each structure, answer **one or two key questions** without overthinking.
- Example: From **Design Thinking** → *“Who is underserved in this system?”*

**Step 3 – Collect Insights and Compare**

- Highlight recurring patterns, tensions or surprising gaps.
- Circle questions that feel **generative** (expand your thinking).

**Step 4 – Synthesize and Reframe**

- Merge promising answers into a **central idea**.
- Start shaping a working thesis or problem statement.

### **Workflow 3 – Interdisciplinary Reframing**

Use this to bring **fresh lenses** from outside your discipline.

**Step 1 – Take an Existing Thesis or Prompt**

- Example: *“AI ethics depends on transparency in algorithm design.”*

**Step 2 – Apply a Structure from Another Field**

- Example: Apply **Hero’s Journey**: *“Who is the hero (AI developer) before the journey (regulation) begins?”*

**Step 3 – Generate Alternative Interpretations**

- Does the new lens **shift the focus** (e.g., from compliance to transformation)?
- Use UST concept tags for deeper reframing.

**Step 4 – Decide on a New Direction**

- Keep the original argument, integrate new insights or pivot entirely.

## Summary of Other Workflows

- **Reviewing Essays:** Map → Diagnose → Reframe → Iterate.  
- **Brainstorming Ideas:** Multi-structure Q&A → Synthesize → Shape a thesis.  
- **Interdisciplinary Reframing:** Cross lens reinterpretation → Generate new insights → Adapt or pivot.

**Core Principle:** UST is not just a planning tool; it’s a **thinking amplifier** for any stage of writing.
